# otp-react-redux

![ORP-RR](orprr.png =500x)

A library for writing modern [OpenTripPlanner](http://www.opentripplanner.org/)-compatible multimodal journey planning applications using [React]() and [Redux]().

*NOTE: OTP-RR is in the very early stages of development and current functionality is extremely limited. An 0.1 version with basic support for itinerary-based planning is targeted for late February / early March 2017.*

## Running the Example

A simple example of an OTP-RR application is included in the repository.

To run, first clone the repo and install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) if needed.

You may want to update `example-config.yml` with the API endpoint and initial map origin. The default values are for a Conveyal test server for Portland, OR.

Start a test instance using yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```
