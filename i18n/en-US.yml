# This file contains localized strings (a.k.a. messages) for the language indicated above:
#   - Messages are organized in various categories and sub-categories.
#   - A component or JS module can use messages from one or more categories.
#   - In the code, messages are retrieved using an ID that is simply the path to the message.
#     Use the dot '.' to separate categories and sub-categories in the path.
#     For instance, for the message defined in YML below:
#         common
#           otpTransitModes
#             subway: Metro#
#     then use the snippet below with the corresponding message id:
#         <FormattedMessage id='common.otpTransitModes.subway' /> // renders "Metro".
#
# It is important that message ids in the code be consistent with
# the categories in this file. Below are some general guidelines:
#   - For starters, there is a 'components' category and a 'common' category.
#     Additional categories may be added as needed.
#   - Each sub-category under 'components' denotes a component and
#     should contain messages that are used only by that component (e.g. button captions).
#   - In contrast, some strings are common to multiple components,
#     so it makes sense to group them by theme (e.g. accessModes) under the 'common' category.


# Component-specific messages (e.g. button captions)
# are defined for each component under the 'components' category.
