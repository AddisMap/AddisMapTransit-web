/**
 * This higher-order component ensures that state.user is loaded
 * in the redux store for any wrapped component that may need it.
 * The requireLoggedInUser argument handles the two use cases for this component:
 * - Some components (e.g. those processing a user account) require a logged in user to be available,
 *   and without it they cannot function.
     For such components, set requireLoggedInUser to true.
 *   An awaiting screen will be displayed while state.user data are being fetched,
 *   and the wrapped component will be shown upon availability of state.user.
 * - Other components (e.g. landing pages) don't require a logged in user to be available to function
 *   but will display extra functionality if so.
 *   For such components, omit requireLoggedInUser parameter (or set to false).
 *   The wrapped component is shown immediately, and no awaiting screen is displayed while state.user is being retrieved.
 * @param {React.Component} WrappedComponent The component to be wrapped to that uses state.user from the redux store.
 * @param {boolean} requireLoggedInUser Whether the wrapped component requires state.user to properly function.
